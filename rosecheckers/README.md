# Rosecheckers Usage

The easiest way to run Rosecheckers is by using the pre-built Docker container:

    docker run -it --rm  docker.pkg.github.com/cmu-sei/cert-rosecheckers/rosebud:latest
    rosecheckers example.c

By default, the container runs `bash`.

This container can also be built and run locally:

    docker build -t docker.pkg.github.com/cmu-sei/cert-rosecheckers/rosebud:latest .
    docker run -it --rm  docker.pkg.github.com/cmu-sei/cert-rosecheckers/rosebud:latest  rosecheckers example.c


# Manual Install
## Prerequesites

This code has been developed and tested on an i386 workstation running Linux (2.6.32-24) and g++ (4.4.3)

This code depends on ROSE 0.9.5a, which is available for free download from

	http://rosecompiler.org/

ROSE 0.9.5a also depends on the BOOST C++ library, version 1.43, which is available for free download from:

	http://www.boost.org/

First make sure that the ROSE environment variable points to the build directory of ROSE:

	export ROSE=/usr/local/rose/compileTree


The build process depends on libtool. It works with GNU libtool version 2.2.6b.
The process also works with G++ 4.4.3.


## Build

To build the 'rosecheckers' program, which runs secure coding rules:

	make pgms

To test rosecheckers on the code samples from the CERT C Secure Coding Rules:

	make tests

To build API documentation pages, you must have doxygen installed:

	make doc

To clean documentation pages and build files:

	make clean


## Running

To run the rosecheckers program on a C or C++ source file, simply pass the file as an argument:

	rosecheckers example.c

If the file takes special arguments to compile properly, such as an include path, simply pass to rosecheckers the same arguments you would pass to GCC or G++.

If the C file violates some secure coding rules, the rosecheckers program will print them out. If the rosecheckers program can not find any violations, it prints nothing.


# Integration of Rosecheckers into a Build Process

The two main ways to run rosecheckers are (1) by hooking into
`gcc/g++` and (2) by using the shell log method. This section also
provides technical detail required to use these methods and examples
of running `rosecheckers`.

Detail: The `rosecheckers` command takes the same arguments as the GCC
compiler, but instead of compiling the code, `rosecheckers` prints
alerts. To run `rosecheckers` on a single file, pass `rosecheckers`
the same arguments that you would pass to GCC. You do not have to
explicitly specify warnings to GCC like you do when harvesting its
output.

## Method 1: Hook into `gcc/g++`

Hook into `gcc/g++` as follows:

   a. Copy the following files from `gcc_as_rosecheckers` or `g++_as_rosecheckers` to `gcc` or `g++`.
   b. Make the renamed files executable: `chmod 700 rosecheckers-code/rosecheckers/g++; chmod 700 rosecheckers-code/rosecheckers/gcc`
   g. Add the path to the scripts to the `PATH` variable:
       * `export PATH=/usr/rosecheckers:$PATH`
   h. Perform a normal build, and redirect the raw output into a text file. (To do this step, see section below about how to run `rosecheckers` with a mounted external source volume.)

## Sample Run

You should hook into `gcc/g++` prior to doing the sample run.
For running rosecheckers on a single file, do the following (example on a single file below named `example.c` )

  * `docker run -it --rm  docker.pkg.github.com/cmu-sei/cert-rosecheckers/rosebud:latest  rosecheckers example.c`


## Method 2: Shell Log

In this approach, you run the normal working build, but log raw text
output produced by `make`. Use that output to build a shell script that
runs rosecheckers on the same files built by GCC. Follow these steps:

  * Build a `makelog` file, which captures standard output and error
    from a successful build. (This assumes that your build process
    prints the commands it executes, which is the default behavior
    of `make`). A suitable command to generate the text data for an example project
    that has a Makefile that builds `all` is:
    ```
    make all >&makelog
    ```
  * Run `$SCALE_HOME/scripts/demake.py` on the `makelog` file, which
    prunes out the '`make`' commands and directory changes.
    ```
    python demake.py < makelog > output
    ```
  * Prune out lines with `:`(they indicate warnings and errors). You could use the following command, which does a per-file search (the `f` of `fgrep`) that inverts matched lines (inversion specified by the `-v` parameter) :

    ```
    fgrep -v : < output > cleaned_up_output
    ```
  * Remove any other lines that would break this shell script.
  * Substitute `rosecheckers` for each occurrence of `gcc` or `g++`, as follows:
    ```
    sed 's/gcc/rosecheckers/' cleaned_up_output > script_that_runs_rosecheckers_for_gcc
    sed 's/g++/rosecheckers/' script_that_runs_rosecheckers_for_gcc > script_that_runs_rosecheckers.sh
    ```
  * Run Bash on the shellscript, and save the output in a text file.
    ```
    ./script_that_runs_rosecheckers.sh >&output_from_rosecheckers.txt
    ```

## Using One of the Two Run Methods in the rosecheckers Container

The technique for using either a hook into `gcc/g++` or a shell log method inside a container is the same as for using it outside a container. First issue the command `docker run -it <other-args> rosecheckers bash`, and then in the container's bash shell do either the `gcc/g++` hook or the shell-log method as described above.

### Running Rosecheckers with a Mounted External Source Volume

Do the following to run the rosecheckers container on your codebase (consisting of multiple files), which will mount a shared volume (sharing the codebase files between the container and your local machine):

 * `export MY_PROJECT=/path/to/my/project/on/host`
 * `docker run -it -v ${MY_PROJECT}:/my_project rosecheckers bash`
 * Then in the bash prompt:
   * `cd /my_project`
 * Next, run `rosecheckers` using Method 1 or Method 2 described above.
   * Method 1: Build the project by using the script(s) you named `gcc` and/or `g++` on your code project. The script will also run rosecheckers.
     * `gcc file1.c file2.c file3.c file4.c`
   * Method 2: Build the project using the shell-log method for Makefiles, described in the section above.

Finally, `exit` or `logout` or `ctrl-d` in bash exits bash and removes the container (but leaves the image intact).

Note: All of the above assumes that your project will build in the `rosecheckers` container, which runs Ubuntu 18 (bionic). If you need extra dependencies, such as `clang`, you can `apt install` them in the container. Or, you could modify the `Dockerfile` if you want those extras included in the image (and all subsequent container)
